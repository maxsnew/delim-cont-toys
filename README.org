* Types for Delimited Continuations
- CM.hs: an implementation of Danvy-Filinski's shift and reset as a
  delimited continuation indexed monad (based on Atkey's "Parameterised Notions of Computation").
- df.rkt: a redex model of Danvy-Filisnki's shift and reset type
  system with answer type changing (broken I think).
- callcc.rkt: a redex model of "delimited callcc", based on Racket's
  behavior (this actually found a bug in Racket lol).
